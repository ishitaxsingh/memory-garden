# Do not user any external api or dependency until its absolutely necessary. Your first approach should be to try and make the thing without any external api.
# When the user mentions Adobe Firefly or any API, provide full working fetch/axios code with setup steps.
# Add comments that explain where to insert their API key or modify parameters.
# Suggest relevant API endpoints or capabilities based on the goal (e.g., image generation, vector manipulation).
# Explain how to setup this api and why is it necessary in the simplest terms
