# If asked to create animations, default to CSS transitions or GSAP for simple, expressive effects.
# If working with SVG, use inline SVG with IDs so it can be animated easily.
# If the user wants to “interact with vectors” or “manipulate shapes,” use Canvas or SVG and explain how it works.
# Use mouse/touch interactions that feel intuitive and modern.
