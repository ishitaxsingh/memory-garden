# Prioritize HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SVG code that is clean and minimal.
# Avoid long boilerplate code unless explicitly asked.
# Structure plugin code using official documentation patterns (e.g., Figma plugin manifest, Illustrator ExtendScript).
# Refer to internet for up to date documentation on all the tech that you might be using.
# Use online-friendly code that can run in platforms like CodePen, JSFiddle, or Glitch.
# Keep the code extremely simple to use so that the users don't have to worry about compiling or building with some tool.
