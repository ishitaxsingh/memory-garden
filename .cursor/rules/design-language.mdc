# Accept visual language and UX terms in prompts, and map them to appropriate code.
# For example: 
# "smooth animation" → use easing functions like ease-in-out;
# "rounded friendly UI" → use border-radius and soft shadows;
# "elegant layout" → use white space, alignment, and typography adjustments.
# If the user describes UI like “like Material Design” or “like After Effects easing,” use those design systems as references.
