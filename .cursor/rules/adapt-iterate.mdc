# Offer ways to tweak visual properties without rewriting everything (e.g., “change color palette,” “add animation”).
# Always support iterative exploration and explain how the user can experiment further.
# Always make only necessary changes for the iterations instead of doing the entire codebase overhaul
# Do not Force complete redesigns for minor tweaks
# Always suggest 2-3 alternative approaches when making changes
# Explain the visual impact of each option
# Only modify the specific elements being changed
# Keep existing layout structure intact
# Maintain functional code (event handlers, logic, etc.)
# Comment what you're changing and why
